# BrainFlood
Idea submission of Codefundo++ :

# Phase 1 : 

* In phase 1 , we look at predicting the occurrence of a natural disaster , specifically earthquakes and floods with  a time series analysis model  using spatial and geographical datasets of past years .
* We plan to analyse the rainfall patterns as well to predict the occurrence of floods
* Perform a # tag filtration on twitter, to know about any sudden events happening by prioritizing the news source for example :  accu   weather or any local news channel and notify people based on that.

# Phase 2 :

In Phase 2 , we look at the measures that can be taken when a disaster strikes , to help people evacuate and minimize the loss of lives. We are specifically looking at floods while providing the solution through a rescue portal.The user will be able to immediately update his/her live location (in form of pins on map in the portal ) using GPS signals and we maintain a counter for the pins and send help accordingly. The features of our portal are as follows:

1. In the region of affected areas , We(The rescue portal) will find out the nearby high altitude areas using google map elevation API and navigate all the people of nearby affected low lying areas to those safe high altitude areas by SMS and GPS Signals.
This helps in speeding up the rescue process by
 * rescuing more number of people in a shorter span of time
 * easier access to high altitude safe zones 
 
2. The ability for users to mark “DONT-GO” zones on the map in the rescue portal, which gets updated in real-time for other users using GPS signals. In case the internet is down, then SMS updates of “DONT-GO” zones are sent .
 
3. We plan on integrating the google road API with the help of which  a user  can snap(pin)  his route of evacuation on the map and share it with the other users to let them know the safe route .

We intend of reducing the usuage of internet as much as possible because of disruption of service during any disaster. As an alternative we look at using GPS signals wherever possible



# Further Enhancements:

Dashboard to coordinate :
* Volunteering activity such as food and resource donation, 
* On ground rescue effort team formation and activity, 
* Handling help requests from victim
* medical assistance, nearby clinic and hospital info, helpline numbers.
* Optimal real time routing considering weather and broken down pathway
